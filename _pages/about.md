I am a Ph.D. candidate and research assistant at the National Chiao Tung University Institute of Business and Management in Taipei, Taiwan. 


Competition Network Dynamics
======
My research has involved diverse areas of platform competition in business ecosystems and two-sided marktes, empirical and game-theoretic analysis of corporate social responsiblity initiatives, and patent citation network analysis for knowledge base comparison, and inter-organizational network analysis with applications to competitive dynamics.  My dissertation, supervised by Assoc. Prof. Jin-Su Kang, investigates inter-firm competition network dynamics. Combining network analysis methodologies with the competitive dynamics theory, I investigate the factors impacting competition formation as well as the effect that changes in the competition network structure have upon strategic decisions, such as acquisition target selection and rivals' competitive (re)actions.
