### Abstract 
The Awareness-Motivation-Capability (AMC) framework instructs firms to be aware of rivals, yet it offers limited guidance on how to profile those who are not yet rivals but stand to become so.  To make the awareness construct prescient we start by acknowledging that rivals are embedded in dyads, triads, tetrads, etc.—so by taking a multilevel view (i.e., firm, dyad, and network), we develop four awareness cues to define a hostility profile.  Studying thousands of competitive encounters over ten years, we show that at the firm and dyad levels, respectively, diversification and asymmetric pressure (the differential exposure to competitive pressure from other players) predict competitive encounters.  Awareness cues at the network level also precede competitive encounters: network convergence drives the formation of triadic encounters (when a focal firm encounters the rivals of its rivals); and the degree of separation among indirect competitors defines the outer bounds of the hostility profile for the focal firm.  That is, direct rivals and 2nd- and 3rd-degree indirect competitors merit awareness—more distal players do not.  Together, the awareness cues and hostility profile delineate the conceptual bound within which awareness is prescient and beyond which it is misplaced.  Challenging several assumptions, our study shows that an arena view assists in predicting cross-industry competition, that to better foresee competition it is advisable to apply firm, dyad and network levels of analysis, that we can “see” rivals before they strike, and that indirect competitors are “profilable.”
